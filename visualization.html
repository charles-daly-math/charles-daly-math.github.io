            <p class="lead" style="position:relative;">
            Here you'll find some animations and pictures of mathematical objects I've made in some of my free time.  Most of them are either from some projects I did experimenting with four dimensional rotations and stereographic projection, or animations of the action of the projective group acting on an affine patch.  All of these are made in Mathematica.

It is worth mentioning that the outer most `bubble' is actually projected to the complement of what you see.  For instance, when the outside of this bubble blob is either entirely red or blue, the red or blue bubble is projected to the red or blue outer layer, but also everything lying outside and away from the bubble blob.  This is to say that the image of the stereographic projection is all of space.</p>

One of the few invariants of the affine group is the notion of parallelism.  Parallel lines are send to parallel lines under affine transformations.

For example, a transformation taking $(x,y)$ to the point $(x,y)/(sy+1)$ for varying $s$ is depicting above.

                        <p>A picture of the (3,3,7) hyperbolic tiling.  In the hyperbolic plane, all these triangles are the same area.  These hyperbolic triangle have angles $\pi/3, \pi/3$ and $\pi/7$.  In the hyperbolic plane, specifying these angles unqiuely determines the triangle up to isometry, unlike the Euclidean plane.  The tiling is generated by taking that unique triangle and reflecting it about all three edges and going wild.  The blue triangles are the ones you get from an even number of flips, and the pink triangles are the ones you get from an odd number of flips.  </p>

Pick your favorite blue one for example.  Around one vertex you can spin around and get 5 triangles.  Around another vertex you can spin around and get 7 triangles.  Around the last vertex you can spin and get two triangles.  This occurs because of the way the groups are defined by reflections and the angle sums around each vertex have to add up to $2\pi$.  </p>

                        <p>Here's one last one where all the you get 5 triangles around each vertex.  There's going to be a unique triangle for each such triple $(n,m,p)$ where $1/m + 1/n + 1/p < 1$.  This is a consequence of some relatively basic planar hyperbolic trigonometry and the hyperbolic version of the Pythagorean theorem.  Caroline Series, Sara Maloni, and Khadija Farooq have some really nice notes of this I suggest checking out if you are interested.  However, this is not true in the projective case, and as a consequence you can typically deform these groups.  Check out Antonin Lukyanenko's Master's thesis for projective deformations of these groups.
